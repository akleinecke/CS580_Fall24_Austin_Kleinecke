## Instructions
The assignment3.py file was created for ease of use and can be run via "./assignment3.py" .

If you have additional data, you may include the file name as a parameter: "./assignment3.py <file_name>"


Note: This code does NOT check for errors in your additional file name. So if you misspell it, the code might just break or yell at you!
